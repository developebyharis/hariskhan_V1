I am a software engineer based in Peshawar, Pakistan. I have created a portfolio website to showcase my skills, achievements, projects and experiences. I will share with you some of the features and design choices of my portfolio website.

My portfolio website has four main sections: About, Awards, Experiences, Education, Projects and Contact. In the About section, I introduce myself and give a brief overview of my education, skills and interests. In the Awards section, I display the certificates and honors that I have received for my academic and professional excellence. In the Projects section, I present some of the most interesting and challenging projects that I have worked on or contributed to, along with the technologies and tools that I used. In the Contact section, I provide my email address and social media links for anyone who wants to get in touch with me.

One of the most interesting feature the portfolio have is Chatbot which can you you get the information more easily of the portfolio you can ask him a question and he would give the answer based on that data he have or on the data that portfolio website contain.

I chose a simple and elegant design for my portfolio website, using a light theme and a responsive layout. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end development, and veecel for hosting portfolio website. I also used TailwindCSS for the styling and for vanilla JavaScript the interactivity. I wanted to make my portfolio website easy to navigate, user-friendly and visually appealing.

I hope you enjoy browsing through my portfolio website and learning more about me and my work. If you have any feedback, questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me. Thank you for your time and attention.
